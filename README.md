# Personal Online Portfolio (Challenge 02)


## Description

This portfolio was created in order to compile a singular, accessable, online location to serve as a page to 
view informaiton about me and the projects I have completed. It was built to show my work to potential employers
and anyone else who would be inerested. It allows me to provide a single link to my entire portfolio instead of
linking all of my eventual projects seperately. This project taught how to specifically style a webpage by 
connecting CSS rules to HTML files. It contains many valuable CSS properties including flexboxes, 
media queries, navigation bars, and more.
